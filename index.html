            <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
            <p>Was born the year I was born, 1955. And I will always remember his passing on my birthday. The most amazing and best graduation speech ever delivered was his speech at Stanford University.<br><br>Vanessa</p><br><br>
            <h3>sorry for your loss</h3>
            <p>To Apple and Jobs family. Steves soul remains in each of these greats products that this and next generations Will love Forever. <br><br>Nicolas</p><br><br>

            <h3>Heartfelt Condolences</h3>
            <p>Dear All, I would like to convey my heartfelt condolences to Laurene Jobs, her family and everyone else who worked with and loved Steve Jobs. His life has truly touched many. I am truly appreciative of the gifts in my life thanks to Apple products. The iPhone and the iPad have been great tools for me to reach out and touch my loved ones. I enclose prayers for Steve and his family. <br><br>Renee</p><br><br>
            <h3>Just want to thank everyone…</h3>
           <p>I am relatively new to the world of Mac. Bought one for music recording, and now I have a hard time using my PC in work and real life at the house. Everything makes sense. Steve seemingly surrounded himself by the best and brightest, to make the best and brightest devices. Were they top notch top technology? In some ways, yes. Were they perfect in their design, and function, most definitely. I hope with his impact on the world, he can make it a better place. <br><br>Anthony</p><br><br>
           <h3>R.I.P Steve Jobs</h3>
           <p>Thank you for making incredible products! We can live in the present and the future thanks to your brililant ideas! We could share enjoyment and remember every precious moment through iPhone/iPad! And also we could feel the strong ability of human not machine! We'll remember your words! 'Stay hungry, Stay foolish!' Steve, you were the greatest existence to people all over the world and you are/will the memorable person in our minds FOREVER! R.I.P Steve Jobs! We'll remember you forever! <br><br>Sierra</p><br><br>

           <h3>My lifelong dream of netting Steve jobs</h3>
            <p>Hi I'm only 12 years old but i am the most DIE HARD apple fan! I have bought both iPads the iPhone 3G, IPhone 4 and will be pre ordering the 4S. I also have a MacBook pro! I have always wanted to meet the person I admire the most! But I guess that won't happen, I wish Steve jobs to rest in peace. And I send my best regards to his family and friends. He will always be the most innovative and awesome inventor. If he hadn't made the iMac we would all be staring at big computer towers! May he rest in peace. <br><br>Jill</p><br><br>
            
            <h3>A heartfelt thank you</h3>
            <p>Ever since my first Apple to my first Macintosh, over 20 years ago, your inspiration was what kept driving me to where I am today. Without your passion and genius, I would not have had the opportunity to develop my core skills and assets I pride myself in. For someone I do not know on a personal level, you have had the most impact on my life. For this, I send out a heartfelt thank you and my deepest condolences. What a life to celebrate and to remember. <br><br>Leo</p><br><br>
            
            <h3>God bless Steve</h3>
            <p>Steve Jobs will forever leave a mark on this planet, he will in turn never die. God bless Steve Jobs. <br><br>Joseph</p>
